## 📂 Project Structure

The repository consists of the following structure:


If you're seeing your content display in a paragraph form instead of the intended format, it could be due to incorrect Markdown syntax or file formatting issues. To make sure everything displays correctly, here's how to ensure proper formatting in your README.md file:

Steps to Fix:
Ensure Correct Line Breaks:
Use empty lines between headings, paragraphs, and list items.
Use triple backticks ``` for code blocks or directory structures.
Here’s the corrected Markdown version for your README.md:

### Key Tips:
- **Triple backticks**: Use triple backticks (` ``` `) to format code blocks or directory structures. This prevents GitHub from rendering it as a paragraph.
- **Ensure Spacing**: Leave empty lines between sections, headings, and paragraphs to avoid them getting merged.
- **Directory and Code Blocks**: Always enclose directory structures and code in triple backticks to preserve their formatting.

If this content is properly placed in your `README.md` file and committed to GitHub, it should render with the correct formatting.
